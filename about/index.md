## Hello there! 

<div class="about">
    <p class="intro">
        I am Lilianne Nakazono, I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Astronomy at Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas, University of São Paulo. I am part of the S-PLUS collaboration, which is an ongoing all-sky survey that will cover about 9300 squared degrees of the Southern Sky. In my current project, I aim to find and to characterize new quasares in this photometric dataset. My main research interests involve the application of Statistical Learning/Machine Learning in the Extragalactic Astronomy context. Well, in other words: I enjoy working with big data :) </p>

## Why Astronomy?

I don't have a beautiful story from childhood as most astronomers do. However I always wanted to become a scientist, no matter in what subject. There were two types of subject that intregued me: really small things that I couldn't even see (Microbiology) and huge stuff around there that I couldn't even imagine (Astronomy). 
I started in Statistics at University of São Paulo, because at that time I still didn't know what I really wanted, but I knew that a degree in Statistics could be useful to me at any path I would choose later. 
In 2012 I was in the middle of the Statistics bachelor's degree program when I started participating in a amateur astronomy club, where I had astronomy classes every saturday. Then my decision was finally done, I couldn't see myself doing anything else than Astronomy at that moment. Well, in 2013 I got my degree and in 2014 I started the Astronomy program. <br>
And here I am :)
