## Hello there! 


I am Lilianne Nakazono, I am a grad student at University of São Paulo in Brazil. I have been working with massive astronomical databases applying statistics and computational methods in order to find new unclassified quasars. 
I enjoy everything that involves data to work with! 



## Why Astronomy?

I don't have a beautiful story from childhood as most astronomers do. However I always wanted to become a scientist, no matter in what subject. There were two types of subject that intregued me: really small things that I couldn't even see (Microbiology) and huge stuff around there that I couldn't even imagine (Astronomy). 
I started in Statistics at University of São Paulo, because at that time I still didn't know what I really wanted, but I knew that a degree in Statistics could be useful to me at any path I would choose later. 
In 2012 I was in the middle of the Statistics bachelor's degree program when I started participating in a amateur astronomy club, where I had astronomy classes every saturday. That was crucial for me, I couldn't see myself doing anything else than Astronomy at that moment. Well, in 2013 I got my degree and in 2014 I started the Astronomy program. And here I am.
