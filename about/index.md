## Hello there! 

<div class="about">
    <p class="intro">
        I am Lilianne Nakazono, I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Astronomy at Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas (USP). I have two B.Sc. degrees in Astronomy and in Statistics. I am part of the S-PLUS collaboration, which is an ongoing all-sky survey that will cover about 9300 squared degrees of the Southern Sky. In my current project I aim to find and to characterize new quasars in this photometric dataset. My main research interests involves the application of Statistical Learning/Machine Learning in the Extragalactic Astronomy context. Well, in other words: I enjoy working with big data :)

## Get to really know me
In my spare time I love playing videogames and boardgames in general. 
I am always reading books, specially japanese literature. Sorry, sci-fi is not my favorite genre! I am currently learning how to play shamisen (jiuta), the 3-stringed traditional japanese instrument. By the way, this picture in the background of the Milky Way was taken by myself (not visible in mobile).
