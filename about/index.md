## Hello there! 

<div class="about">
    <p class="intro">
        I am Lilianne Nakazono, I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Astronomy at Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas, University of São Paulo. I am part of the S-PLUS collaboration, which is an ongoing all-sky survey that will cover about 9300 squared degrees of the Southern Sky. In my current project I aim to find and to characterize new quasares in this photometric dataset. My main research interests involves the application of Statistical Learning/Machine Learning in the Extragalactic Astronomy context. Well, in other words: I enjoy working with big data :)

## Why Astronomy?

I don't have a beautiful story from childhood as most astronomers do. However, I always wanted to become a scientist, no matter in what subject. I started in a bachelor program in Statistics at University of São Paulo in 2010
In 2012 I was in the middle of the Statistics bachelor's degree program when I started participating in a amateur astronomy club, where I had astronomy classes every saturday. Then my decision was finally done, I couldn't see myself doing anything else than Astronomy at that moment. Well, in 2013 I got my degree and in 2014 I started the Astronomy program. <br>
And here I am :)
