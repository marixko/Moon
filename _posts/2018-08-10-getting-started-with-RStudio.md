RStudio is a great IDE for the programming language R, useful for statistical computing and data visualization. It’s available for Windows, macOS, Ubuntu and Fedora and you can download it <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">here</a>

## Advantages:
* It has an  user-friendly interface, but you can also do code-based things at the same time
* It helps you to organize your work
* You can search the documentation without having to go to your browser
* Version control system

Here I’m going to show you the basics to get started with RStudio within a R Script. In this post I’m not going through other really useful ways to write your code like R Notebook or Shiny Web App, but after getting the basics you’ll be able to try those out by yourself! 

First you have to open RStudio, click on the first icon at your top-left side and create a new R Script.
